## Features

- **Dynamic Gradients:** The background consists of multiple radial gradients with varying colors and stops. The gradients change dynamically based on the provided `animationValue`.

- **Geometric Shapes:** The painter draws circles and paths to create intricate geometric patterns. These shapes contribute to the overall visual richness of the background.

- **Animation:** Utilizes Flutter's animation capabilities to create visually appealing transitions in the background. The `animationValue` controls the progression of the animations.
